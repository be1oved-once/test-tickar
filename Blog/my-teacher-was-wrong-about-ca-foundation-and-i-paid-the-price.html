  <h1>My Teacher Was Wrong About CA Foundation - And I Paid the Price</h1>

  <!-- ================= EMOTIONAL START ================= -->

  <p>
    Writing this feels uncomfortable.
    Not because it attacks teachers -
    but because it attacks a belief I trusted blindly.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a long time, I believed something very deeply:
    <strong>“If I follow my teacher exactly, I will clear CA Foundation.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn’t question strategies.
    I didn’t analyse results.
    I didn’t adapt.
  </p>

  <p>
    I obeyed.
    And when the result came,
    obedience did not save me.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a story about blaming a teacher.
    This is a story about what happens
    when students outsource thinking
    in an exam that demands independent execution.
  </p>

  <h2>The Trust Phase: When You Stop Thinking for Yourself</h2>

  <p>
    My teacher was experienced.
    Confident.
    Respected.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone like that speaks,
    you listen.
    When they give a plan,
    you follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Do the full syllabus.”
    “Don’t skip anything.”
    “Just write everything you know.”
  </p>

  <p>
    These instructions sounded safe.
    Responsible.
    Logical.
  </p>

  <p>
    And that is exactly why they were dangerous.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Students Believe Teachers Blindly</h2>

  <p>
    CA Foundation students are insecure.
    They are new to professional exams.
    They are afraid of making wrong decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    So when a teacher gives certainty,
    students grab it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Certainty feels better than confusion.
    Even if it’s wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    I stopped asking:
    “Does this work for me?”
    “Is this practical in the exam?”
  </p>

  <p>
    I replaced those questions with:
    “Sir ne bola hai.”
  </p>

  <!-- ================= MISTAKES SECTION ================= -->

  <h2>Mistake #1: Treating CA Foundation Like a School Exam</h2>

  <p>
    My teacher’s biggest mistake
    was not understanding how CA Foundation actually works.
  </p>

  <p>
    The strategy was based on coverage,
    not conversion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finish the syllabus.
    Revise twice.
    Write long answers.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach works in theory.
    It collapses in the exam hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    CA Foundation is not about how much you know.
    It is about how much you can <strong>deliver under pressure</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Mistake #2: “Don’t Skip Anything” Is Terrible Advice</h2>

  <p>
    This advice destroyed my attempt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of strengthening scoring areas,
    I spread my energy thin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Weak chapters stayed weak.
    Strong chapters never became perfect.
  </p>

  <p>
    The exam does not reward equality.
    It rewards prioritisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I was never taught how to prioritise.
  </p>

  <h2>Mistake #3: No One Taught Me Question Selection</h2>

  <p>
    In class, everything was about answering.
    Nothing was about choosing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the exam,
    choice matters more than content.
  </p>

  <p>
    I attempted questions emotionally -
    not strategically.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yeh chapter padha hai, likh deta hoon.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I never asked:
    “Is this the safest question for marks?”
  </p>

  <h2>Mistake #4: Writing More Was Treated as Writing Better</h2>

  <p>
    My answers were long.
    Very long.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believed length showed effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    In reality,
    length often hides lack of clarity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examiner ko points chahiye hote hain.
    Not emotional explanations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was never corrected in class.
  </p>

  <h2>Mistake #5: Mock Tests Were Optional</h2>

  <p>
    Mock tests were treated like extra practice.
    Not compulsory training.
  </p>

  <p>
    I avoided them.
    No one stopped me.
  </p>

  <p>
    No one explained
    that mock tests are where exam fear is created -
    and then destroyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I entered the exam hall untested.
    The exam tested me brutally.
  </p>

  <h2>Mistake #6: Exam Temperament Was Never Discussed</h2>

  <p>
    No one taught me:
    how to handle panic,
    how to move on from a bad question,
    how to manage time loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teachers talk about syllabus.
    Exams test temperament.
  </p>

  <p>
    This gap cost me marks I could have easily saved.
  </p>

  <h2>The Result Day: When Reality Hits Hard</h2>

  <p>
    The result didn’t shock me.
    It disappointed me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because deep down,
    I knew I didn’t perform well -
    even though I studied hard.
  </p>

  <p>
    That contradiction hurts the most.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Itne ghante padhke bhi?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes.
    Because hours don’t convert themselves into marks.
  </p>

  <!-- ================= LESSONS SECTION ================= -->

  <h2>Lesson #1: Teachers Teach Subjects, Not Your Exam</h2>

  <p>
    This is the hardest truth to accept.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teachers teach content.
    Exams test execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Execution is your responsibility.
    Not theirs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Blind obedience removes accountability -
    and accountability is required to clear CA.
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson #2: One Strategy Never Fits All</h2>

  <p>
    If a strategy works for 10 students,
    it can still fail for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your strengths,
    speed,
    memory,
    writing ability -
    all matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    You must customise.
    Or you will suffer.
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson #3: Marks Are Earned by Selection, Not Sincerity</h2>

  <p>
    The exam does not know your intention.
  </p>

  <p>
    It only sees your answers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Selection of questions,
    selection of points,
    selection of time -
    this is where marks are created.
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson #4: Mock Tests Are Non-Negotiable</h2>

  <p>
    Mock tests are not about scores.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are about stress exposure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The more familiar stress becomes,
    the weaker it gets.
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned this too late.
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson #5: Respect Teachers, But Don’t Surrender Thinking</h2>

  <p>
    This is the balance most students miss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Respect experience.
    But verify with performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    If something isn’t improving your marks,
    loyalty won’t fix it.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Reality</h2>

  <p>
    My teacher was not evil.
    Not careless.
  </p>

  <p>
    The advice was generic.
    The exam was not.
  </p>

  <p>
    I paid the price
    because I didn’t adapt early.
  </p>

  <p>
    CA Foundation doesn’t punish bad teachers.
    It punishes passive students.
  </p>

  <p>
    Think.
    Test.
    Adapt.
  </p>
