  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    At <strong>Tic.Kar</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to
    protecting any information you share while using our platform.
    This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used,
    and how we safeguard it.
  </p>

  <p>
    By accessing or using Tic.Kar, you acknowledge that you have read,
    understood, and agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you should discontinue
    using the website.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar collects only the minimum information required to provide a smooth
    and meaningful learning experience. This may include basic account details
    such as an email address or username if you choose to sign in, along with
    practice-related data such as attempts, scores, accuracy, streaks, and
    general usage statistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may also collect limited technical information such as device type,
    browser information, and page visit counts to help monitor performance
    and improve platform stability. Tic.Kar does <strong>not</strong> collect
    sensitive personal information such as phone numbers, physical addresses,
    financial data, or government-issued identifiers.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p>
    The information collected on Tic.Kar is used strictly for educational,
    analytical, and operational purposes. This includes tracking learning
    progress, generating performance insights, improving accuracy and
    efficiency, and enhancing the overall user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data may also be used to maintain basic security, detect misuse,
    and ensure the platform functions reliably. Tic.Kar does
    <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, lease, or trade user information to
    third parties under any circumstances.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar may use cookies or browser-based local storage technologies
    to manage sessions, maintain login states, remember user preferences
    such as theme selection, and store limited activity data for convenience.
  </p>

  <p>
    These technologies do not collect personally identifiable information
    beyond what is required for core functionality and user experience.
    You may choose to disable cookies through your browser settings,
    though some features may not function as intended.
  </p>

  <h2>Practice Content and User Activity</h2>

  <p>
    All practice attempts, answers, and performance data are stored solely
    to help users analyze their preparation and improve academically.
    Your answers are not publicly shared with other users.
  </p>

  <p>
    If leaderboards or comparison features are present, they display
    limited information strictly for academic reference. Wherever possible,
    data is processed in an aggregated or anonymized form.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar may rely on third-party services for infrastructure, hosting,
    authentication, or analytics. These services are used solely to operate,
    secure, and maintain the platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such third-party providers are governed by their own privacy policies.
    Tic.Kar does not control how external services handle data beyond their
    intended operational purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising and Promotions</h2>

  <p>
    As of now, Tic.Kar does <strong>not</strong> display advertisements,
    sponsored content, tracking pixels, or promotional material.
  </p>

  <p>
    If advertising or monetization features are introduced in the future,
    this Privacy Policy will be updated clearly to reflect such changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>

  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
    user data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.
    These measures include secure authentication mechanisms, restricted
    data access, and ongoing monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, no online platform can guarantee absolute security.
    Users are responsible for safeguarding their login credentials and
    accessing the platform responsibly.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar is intended for students preparing for academic examinations.
    We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below the
    applicable legal age without appropriate consent.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you believe that a minor has unintentionally provided personal
    information, please contact us so corrective action can be taken.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect legal,
    technical, or operational changes. Any updates will be published
    on this page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Continued use of Tic.Kar after updates are made constitutes acceptance
    of the revised Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact Information</h2>

    If you have questions, concerns, or requests related to this Privacy Policy,
    you may contact us using the communication options available on Tic.Kar.
