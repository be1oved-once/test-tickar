  <h2>Purpose of the Platform</h2>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar is an educational practice platform created to help students test
    their preparation through multiple-choice questions, performance tracking,
    and analytical insights. The platform is designed strictly for learning,
    self-evaluation, and practice purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar does not claim to be an official examination body, coaching institute,
    or academic authority. The platform is intended to supplement a student’s
    preparation and should not be treated as a replacement for official study
    materials, textbooks, or professional guidance.
  </p>

  <h2>Content Sources and Ownership</h2>

  <p>
    The questions, concepts, and practice material available on Tic.Kar are
    compiled from a variety of publicly accessible and educational sources,
    including but not limited to previous examinations, textbooks, reference
    materials, online educational platforms, and community-shared resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tic.Kar does not claim original ownership of third-party questions or content.
    Any resemblance to content found elsewhere is incidental and arises due to
    the educational and commonly shared nature of examination material.
